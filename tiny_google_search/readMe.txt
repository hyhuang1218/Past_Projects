tiny-Google search engine

This is a simple search engine, referred to as tiny-Google, to retrieve documents relevant to simple search queries submitted by users. It was implemented using two different computing platforms. The first platform is a socket-based client-server computing model using a traditional file system (in master-slave distributed model). The second platform uses the MapReduce computation model and Hadoop running on a Linux cluster.
