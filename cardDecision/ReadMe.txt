This is a small demo system to support users to choose a personal credit card.
The details of each card are retrieved from bank's official website.

The calculation is based on the probability of approval and the perks the user can get from each card. 
Moreover, the model is constructed using GeNIE developed by University of Pittsburgh, School of Information Sciences.
